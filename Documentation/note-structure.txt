The note data will be stored as JSON, the root strucre will be an object
containing the key value properties of the note.

Date time will be ISO 8601 format,  yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss the time zone is
Greenwich mean time.

When creating a note a Universally unique identifier (UUID) is created to
prevent collisons between notes with the same text.

At a later time each note revision will use delta encoding to save space by
storing the differences between version.

Example:

{
  "encoding": "UTF-8",
  "uuid": "UUID",
  "note_text": "hello world",
  "created_at": "ISO 8601 date time",
  "updated_at": "ISO 8601 date time",
  "author": "optional persons name"
}
