Commits are snapshot of what the project looked like at a certain time and can
be used to get previous versions of notes and project structure. It also keeps
track of changes so that the project synchronized. Commits can also have more
than one parent reference such as when merging branches.
Each commit will be stored as JSON.

Example:

{
    "parent_ref": ["parent SHA-256"],
    "tree_ref": "tree SHA-256",
    "created_at": "ISO 8601 time stamp"
}
