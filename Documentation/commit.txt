a commit is a snapshot of what the project looked like at a certain time and can
be used to get previous versions of notes and project structure. it also keeps
track of changes so that the project synchronized. each commit will be stored in
json.

Example:

{
    "parent_ref": "parent SHA-256",
    "tree_ref": "tree SHA-256"
}
